Sensor Library

This is a collection of sensors and their matching sketches. Each sensor will be accompanied by a 'Library Datasheet'. Each sheet should contain the link to the sensors technical document, as well as other document related to the sensor and node programming. Finally a notes section will be present to highlight any important information for the user, discovered during programming.
