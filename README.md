Install Directions
-----------------------
Step 1: Rename the library to sensing and place it inside of the 'libraries' that is located with the Arduino IDE.<br />
        Windows:  %WhereEverYouPutIt%/ardunio-xxxx/libraries/
        OSx:         Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries/

Step 2: Open the .pde of the device you wish to 'flash'/install, connect it to the Ardunio IDE and upload.

Repeat step 2 for devices as needed.
