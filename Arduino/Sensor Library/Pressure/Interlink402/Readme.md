Interlink 402
===========
 - Type: Force-Sensitive Resistor
 - Output: N - Newtons
 - Model: Interlink 402
 - Use: Force Sensing Resistors (FSR) are a polymer thick film (PTF) device which exhibits a decrease in resistance with an increase in the force applied to the active surface.  Its force sensitivity is optimized for use in human touch control of electronic devices.  FSRs are not a load cell or strain gauge, though they have similar properties.  FSRs are not suitable for precision measurements

Notes
-----
Connect one end of FSR to power, the other end to Analog 0.
Then connect one end of a 10K resistor from Analog 0 to ground.
