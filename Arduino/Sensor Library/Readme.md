Sensor Library
==============
This is a collection of sensors and their matching sketches. Each sensor will be accompanied by a 'Library Datasheet'. Each sheet should contain the link to the sensors technical document, as well as other document related to the sensor and node programming. Finally a notes section will be present to highlight any important information for the user, discovered during programming. All node code is default set to address off of pins 8,9,10.
